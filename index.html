<p>A 30 something year old father, husband, lean, digital enthusiast and aspiring chef! I'm originally from Australia, but due to some of life's unforeseen adventures am now happily settled in Hamburg Germany.</p>
<p>In my spare time <del>I'm also</del> <i>I was</i> also the co-founder of the <del>social</del> <i>failed</i> startup <a href="blog/weave-post">Weave</a>. Our ultimate goal was to help users explore and share meaningful moments through their social network.</p>
<p>I'm really passionate about lean, continuous improvement and applying the principles to all parts of my life - be it data science, business transformation or BBQ'ing!</p>
<p>I've set this site up to act mainly just as a repository of stuff I find interesting & fun - hopefully, others find it the same as well. If you would like to connect with me, share a story or just have a chat about anything, then feel free to have a look around and get in touch.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
