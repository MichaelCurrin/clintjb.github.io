For 18+ years, I have been honing my skills as a technology and business leader in the fields of operations, digitalization, cost reduction and project management. This experience has been developed in increasingly responsible leadership positions in various industries including automotive, aerospace and military.

Quite often strategies aren't effectively implemented, as the disconnect between high-level vision and operational reality is never truly closed. I enjoy nothing more than bringing clever, pragmatic solutions to life to solve these complex problems. 

I am passionate about applying lean culture and principles to data science, transformation and new technologies - with a focus on truly understanding the impacts and drivers at the operational level.

I love developing teams with an entrepreneurial spirit and get the greatest feeling of satisfaction when employees are enabled to think creatively, practice continuous improvement and focus on the things they do best - bringing value to the business.

Iâ€™ve also completed an online MBA developed entirely out of MOOCs from some of the worlds top business programmes. You can find my curriculum & transcript [here](/mba.html)
