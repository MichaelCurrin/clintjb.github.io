Here's a bit of a follow-up to my previous post - [Cool Gifs](https://clintbird.com/blog/cool-gifs-post). I'm an avid comic reader so really enjoyed these, think the gif format really does bring some of these to life - honestly, no idea where I've collected these so if you have any hints / ideas do please let me know...
